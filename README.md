I'm a 21-year-old web developer learning on my own and doing my first year of a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA).
When I'm not coding, I love dancing , singing , listening to all kinds of music, and watching anime.
I'm really into technology and always try to keep up with the latest development trends.
